    "At the centre of the question, is how the condensed water influences the momentum of a cloudy air volume, i.e. how it affects the motion of the moist air continuum within which the droplets/ice particles live. But if you survey the literature, you will find both different interpretations and different definitions, all of which lead to slightly different equations of motion. Yet all of them roughly agree on this: Because the liquid/ice phases are heavier than the moist air in the parcel, they should reduce the parcel \"lightness\", which buoyancy tries to measure. So the droplets will begin to fall with respect to the moist air, and exert a drag force on the air. This drag force reduces the moist air's upwards acceleration due to buoyancy. The effect, the \"liquid-water loading\", is accounted for in almost all quantitative treatments of buoyancy, by adding the negative force, proportional to $T(q_l + q_i)$ to $T_v$ (several other, smaller effects from droplet/air interaction are usually ignored).\n",

Where does the density of liquid water come from, then? It resides in the volume that the liquid takes up. --> -->"
