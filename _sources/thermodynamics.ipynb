    "You might now ask: If the gas law only cares about the number of particles bouncing around $n_0$ (see eq. {eq}``gaslaw-derived``), why would it matter how light those particles are, and why do we need $T_v$? Fundamentally, this comes from our wish to measure atmospheric air properties in mass ($q_v$ and $\\rho_d$) rather than in number of molecules ($n_{d}$, $n_{H_2O}$), and the conversion of the gas law to eq. {eq}``gaslaw-moist`` that was needed to achieve that. The interpretation of $T_v$ follows from this choice: If we have two identical air volumes with the same number of particles $n_0$ at the same temperature $T$, but one of them consists only of dry air particles and the other contains some water vapour molecules, then, because water vapour is lighter than dry air, we will measure the moist air volume to be lighter than the dry air volume. In other words, $\\rho_t$ is lower in the moist volume than in the dry volume. At the same time, because both volumes have the same $n_0$, $T$ and $V$, the gas law demands that they must have the same $p$. To achieve this pressure in the moist volume while using $\\rho_t$ as our air density, we must increase $\\rho_t$ by the factor $1+0.608q_v$ (note that it is always $\\geq 1$!), as we did in eq. {eq}``gaslaw-virt``. By using $T_v$, we choose to account for this effect not by changing the density (where the difference resides), but by changing the temperature [^fntvirt]. This leads to an often-used definition for $T_v$: It is the higher temperature that a mass of dry air (with $\\rho_t$ and $R_d$) would need to have to compensate for the fact that it is heavier than moist air, to exert the same pressure as that moist air.\n",

    "[^fntvirt]: In terms of the kinetic theory, we pretend that when using the dry gas constant for a mass of moist air, thus underestimating the number of particles $n_0$ we actually have in the volume (because we actually need more light water vapour molecules to produce that mass), we can correct for this effect by giving the fewer particles more kinetic energy. In this sense, using $T_v$ is a true trick that gives the right ideal gas description, but the wrong molecular-level description."
